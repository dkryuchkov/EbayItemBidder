Dear Subscriber,

You have used up all your renewals and from now on your adverts will gradually loose their visibility. Your current Gumtree account looks like the follow:

Total active adverts: <itemstotalcount>
Number of adverts that are not on the 1st page: <itemsnotonfirstpage>

We suggest you top-up your account choosing of our new value plans below.
 
We are glad to let you know that due to a high demand for our services, we have substantially reduced our fees.
Also there are a number of new plans that are currently on the offer:

5 renewals. $5
10 renewals. $9
25 renewals. $18
50 renewals. $30
100 renewals. $50 
200 renewals. $70 

Also we have a number of unlimited plans. These are unconstrained by a number of active adverts you might have and will performed an hourly renewal for the period of time chosen - an exception value for money!

Unlimited renewals for 1 week. $100
Unlimited renewals for 2 weeks. $150
Unlimited renewals for 1 month. $200 

If you are after a custom plan, or should you have any questions, please contact info@virtualcolleague.com.au
