description=I bought the bike in beginning of 2017. Looking at the serial number I gather that the bike was built on 12/12/2016. I guess this means 2016 model, although comparing 2017 and mine frames I could not find a single difference, geometry and weight matches gram to gram and mm to mm. Possibly Giant started producing 2017 frame spec at the end of 2016. Up for sale is the amazing 2016 TCR Advanced SL0 Di2 machine.This bike is a lightweight (6.36kg sans pedals) but has the highest stiffness-weight ratio in its class.The frame weighs just 856g, the wheels weigh just 1330g - no need to change out with expensive aftermarket items. You will marvel every time you lift it. It is simply stunning and smooth to ride, offers outstanding acceleration and downhill handling and is one of the best climbers out there.If you have never tried electric gears once you do you will never go back - precise shifting every time, even under load.The bike is an M&#47;L size and suits me perfectly - I am 5.11. I have done less than 1000km on it and am just not using it hence the sale.Grab yourself a bargain - this bike is virtually brand new. Read the reviews and look at the specs - this is a premium spec bike that gets no negative reviews from anybody, it is that good!Please remember these are retail at $9,000 as per standardFrame is ML size (medium&#47;large)The height from the centre of the cranks to top of the saddle is about 720mm SEAT TUBE LENGTH (not including the integrated seatpost)- 426mmSpec:TCR SL0 DURAACE Di2 R9100 Giant Professional grade Advanced SL composite frame with integrated Variant composite seat postColor: Carbon&#47;GrayAdvanced SL-grade composite fork with full-composite Over Drive 2 steererGiant SLR 0 Composite Wheel System with Giant Gavia SLR tubeless tyresShimano Dura-Ace Di2 9150 11-speed electronic componentry
