description=Boston 3 seater Lounge &ndash; Red &amp; Grey RRP $2,683&lt;br&gt;&ldquo;If you stay, I`ll make you a night / Like no night has been or will be again&rdquo; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Boston uses an Early Modern design language and introduces two different tactile surfaces &ndash; reconstituted leather and cashmere-feel fabric, creating a rich and multi-referential design. The padding pattern of the inner armrests continues also on the inner backrest, behind the removable cushions, so if the cushions are removed the Boston becomes a low-look settee with extra-deep seats. A very comfortable and unique combination, with special charms, to be used as a full seating system or as a single-piece design feature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reconstituted buffalo and cowhide leather on front partsMatching grain synthetic leather on rear and hidden parts&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back cushions and accents in cashmere-feel fabric&lt;br&gt;Wide stainless steel feet&lt;br&gt;External measurements: W194cm x D87cm x H86cm&lt;br&gt;Colour: Red with grey&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THIS ADVERT IS MANAGED BY https://gumtree-intforce.rhcloud.com
